#### BURGERS!!!!

With this app, you can log and see all the kinds of burgers we have on the Burgers_db. You can choose to eat a burger, in this case it will move from the "I,m Hungry " side to the "I'm Finished" side. After that you can deelte the burger from the database. 

Also, you can add new burgers to the database, using the "Add a burger" form.
